A basic spell checker that works well with camelCase code.

## Functionality

Load a Typescript, Javascript, Text, etc.. file.  Words not in the dictionary files will have
a squiggly underline.

## Install

Open up VS Code and hit `F1` and type `ext` select install and type `code-spell-checker` hit enter and reload window to enable.

## Supported Languages

* English

## Enabled File Types
* Typescript
* Javascript
* Text
* Markdown
* C#
* Go
* PHP

## How it works with camelCase

The concept is simple, split camelCase words before checking them against a list of known English words.
* camelCase -> camel case
* HTMLInput -> html input
* srcCode -> src code
* snake_case_words -> snake case words
* camel2snake -> camel snake -- (the 2 is ignored)

## Things to note

* This spellchecker is case insensitive.  It will not catch errors like english which should be English.
* The spellchecker uses a local word dictionary.  It does not send anything outside your machine.
* The words in the dictionary can and do contain errors.
* There are missing words.
* Only words longer than 3 characters are checked.  "jsj" is ok, while "jsja" is not.
* All symbols and punctuation are ignored.
* It currently checks ALL text in a document.

## Customization

### Adding words to the Workspace Dictionary

You have the option to add you own words to the workspace dictionary.  The easiest, is to put your cursor
on the word you wish to add, when you light-bulb shows up, hit `Ctrl+.` (windows) / `Cmd+.` (Mac).  You will get a list
of suggestions and the option to add the word.

You can also type in a word you want to add to the dictionary: `F1` `add word` -- select `Add Word to Dictionary` and type in the word you wish to add.

### cSpell.json

Words added to the dictionary are placed in the `cSpell.json` file in the `.vscode` folder found in the _workspace_.
Note, the settings in cSpell.json will override the equivalent cSpell settings in settings.json.

#### Example _cSpell.json_ file

```javascript
// cSpell Settings
{
    // Version of the setting file.  Always 0.1
    "version": "0.1",
    // language - current active spelling language
    "language": "en",
    // words - list of words to be always considered correct
    "words": [
        "mkdirp",
        "tsmerge",
        "githubusercontent",
        "streetsidesoftware",
        "vsmarketplacebadge",
        "visualstudio"
    ],
    // flagWords - list of words to be always considered incorrect
    // This is useful for offensive words and common spelling errors.
    // For example "hte" should be "the"
    "flagWords": [
        "hte"
    ]
}
```
